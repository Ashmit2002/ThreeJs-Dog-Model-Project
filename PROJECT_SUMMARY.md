## 💼 Best For These Interview Questions

### 1. "Tell me about a challenging technical project"
→ **Use**: Material transition challenge (custom shader implementation)

### 2. "How do you optimize performance?"
→ **Use**: Texture optimization + Draco compression + React optimization

### 3. "Describe learning a new technology"
→ **Use**: GLSL shader programming (0 to production in 1 week)

### 4. "Walk me through your development process"
→ **Use**: 7-phase approach (Research → 3D Setup → Shaders → Animation → Interaction → Optimization → CSS)

### 5. "Tell me about a time you solved a difficult problem"
→ **Use**: Scroll performance issue (event listeners → GSAP ScrollTrigger)

## 🎤 Opening Statement for Demo

"I'd love to show you this 3D interactive portfolio I built. It's a full-stack React application using Three.js for 3D rendering, custom GLSL shaders for unique visual effects, and GSAP for professional animations.

The most interesting technical aspect is the material system - I modified Three.js's fragment shader to blend between 20 different textures smoothly. You'll see this in action when I hover over the project titles.

The site also features scroll-based 3D transformations that are perfectly synchronized across four sections, all while maintaining 60fps performance.

Let me walk you through it..."
